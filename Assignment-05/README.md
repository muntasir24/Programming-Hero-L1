#  DOM & Events PH 

## 1. Difference between `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, and `querySelector` / `querySelectorAll`
- **getElementById("id")**  
  - Selects unique `id`. and returns one elemen  
  

- **getElementsByClassName("className")**  
  - Selects multiple elements by their class name.  
  - Returns an **HTMLCollection** (array-like object), not an array and assess via loop if i want to treat is as signle use ('classname')[0].  

- **querySelector("selector")**  
  - Can use CSS selectors (`#id`, `.class`, `div p`, etc.).  
  - Returns the **first matching element**.  

- **querySelectorAll("selector")**  
  - Returns **all elements** that match the CSS selector.  
  - Returns a **NodeList**, which supports `forEach`.

## 2. How to create and insert a new element into the DOM
Simple Steps:  
1. Use `document.createElement("tagName")` to create a new element.  
2. Add text using `.innerText` or i can do simpply with `.innerHtml` .  
3. Insert it into the DOM using `appendChild`.


## 3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
Event bubbling means that when an event happens on a child element, it will first run on that child, then move up to its parent, then further up to the ancestors, all the way to the `document`.

Example: If i click on a button inside a div, the click event first runs on the button, then the div, then body, then document.

## 4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Event delegation is a technique where instead of attaching event listeners to multiple child elements, we attach one listener to their parent. Using `event.target`, we can check which child triggered the event.

**Why useful?**
- Better performance,if we add new element not need to add again evenListener to child.

## 5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
- **preventDefault()** â†’ Stops the browserâ€™s default action (stop form submission).
- **stopPropagation()** â†’ Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
